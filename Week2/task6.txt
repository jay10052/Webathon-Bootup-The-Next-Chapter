1. var (Oldest way to declare variables)
Function-scoped: A variable declared with var is accessible throughout the function where it is declared.
Hoisted: var is hoisted to the top but initialized with undefined.
Can be re-declared and updated within the same scope.

2. let (Preferred for mutable variables)
Block-scoped: A let variable is accessible only within the block where it is defined.
Hoisted but not initialized: Unlike var, it cannot be accessed before declaration (Temporal Dead Zone).
Can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.

3. const (Preferred for constants)
Block-scoped, like let.
Hoisted but not initialized, like let.
Cannot be updated or re-declared after assignment.
